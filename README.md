# Divvy Bike Share Analysis
## Introduction 
In this case study, we are tasked with analyzing the data for Divvy, a bike-share company in Chicago and tasked with maximizing annual memberships through data analysis.
The key objective is to understand differences in bike usage between casual riders and annual members using data from the past 12 months. The public data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). Data used from the past year has been cleaned and combined into the file ```tripdata_cleaned.csv```. Detailed steps about the data cleaning process and the findings can be found in the jupyter notebook file ```main.ipynb```.

## Recommendation from the findings

The analysis shows a clear distinction in the usage patterns between member users and casual users of the bike service. Member users tend to utilize the service during typical commuting hours, possibly to bypass heavy traffic during rush hours. Conversely, casual users prefer weekends and non-rush hours, especially in the summer season, indicating a recreational or leisurely usage pattern.

Based on these patterns, we can infer that member users are likely residents familiar with local commuting needs, while casual users may include tourists or occasional visitors. This distinction implies that member users and casual users represent distinct user groups with different preferences and behaviors.

Consequently, converting casual users into member users is unlikely to be straightforward due to the fundamental differences in their usage habits and motivations. We can explore marketing initiatives and offer summer discounts as incentives to attract casual users.
